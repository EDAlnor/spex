The code in this repository can be used to replicate the results of the paper 'Specialisation versus expertise: Which matters more for the impact of research teams?'. The code is primarily Python, however, some is re-used R from previous projects (e.g., https://github.com/EDAlnor/MeSH-relatedness).
