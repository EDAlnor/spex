The code in this repository can be used to replicate the results of the paper 'Specialisation and expertise of research teams: Which matters more for the impact of their publications?' which has been submitted to Quantitative Science Studies. The data preparation is primarily done in Python, while the analysis is done in R, but some preparation is also done in R because I was able to reuse previous code.
